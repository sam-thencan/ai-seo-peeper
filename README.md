# AI SEO Peeper 👀

**AI SEO Peeper** is a lightweight Chrome Extension for SEOs, marketers, and content creators. It reveals the hidden "fan-out queries" that ChatGPT uses when it browses the web to answer a prompt.

## 🧐 What does it do?
When you ask ChatGPT a question that requires real-time data (e.g., *"Best pizza in Chicago"*), it doesn't just run one search. It often "fans out" multiple specific search queries to Bing to gather information.

Normally, these queries are hidden. **AI SEO Peeper** intercepts them in real-time and displays them in a clean, non-intrusive UI.

* **🕵️‍♂️ Reveal Hidden Intent:** See exactly what keywords the AI uses to find answers.
* **⚡ Real-Time Stream:** Queries appear instantly as ChatGPT "thinks."
* **📋 One-Click Copy:** Easily grab the full list of queries for your keyword research.
* **🫣 Minimized Mode:** Tucks away into a subtle "Eye" icon when you don't need it.
